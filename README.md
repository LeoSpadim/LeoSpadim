## Hi there, I'm Leo, an indie game developer and 3D artist!

Graduated in Digital Games, I work on my independent game projects but also develop for other companies. In addition to programming, I also dedicate myself to 3D art, sculpture, and animation for games.

Currently, I am studying web development and starting a degree in Design. I intend to not only master website creation but also become a specialist in UI & UX Design.
